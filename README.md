React, managed by Facebook and a vibrant community of developers and companies, is a JavaScript library designed to craft dynamic user interfaces. It empowers developers with concepts like React web apps, components, props, states, and component lifecycles. With a primary focus on building single-page web or mobile applications, ReactJS revolutionizes the way interactive interfaces are developed.
